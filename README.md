# Rotating_Circles_UI_JavaFX
 Two balls spin along two concentric circles in opposite direction. A slider at the bottom part allows to change the speed of their movement: the scale from 0 to 1 corresponds to the frequency of the outer ball â€” from zero to 1 Hz (one revolution per second). The inner ball rotates with frequency 1 Hz when the slider is at the zero position to zero when it is at the position 1.
